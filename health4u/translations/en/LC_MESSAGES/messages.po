"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by "
"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease "
"was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's "
"Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing "
"2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough and "
"shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, "
"diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain. The time from "
"exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range "
"from two to fourteen days. While the majority of cases result in mild "
"symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure. As "
"of 11 April 2020, more than 1.69 million cases have been reported in more "
"than 200 countries and territories, resulting in more than 102,000 deaths. "
"More than 376,000 people have recovered."
